# Overview  
This PRD defines the objectives, scope, and technical requirements for the development of a security defense system for Modular Context Protocol (MCP) against Adversarial Tool-Calling Attacks (ATCA). The proposed system aims to integrate network security-inspired mechanisms into the LLM+Tool ecosystem to enhance resilience against prompt injection, malicious tool misuse, and semantic context exploits.

The system will serve as a critical security layer for AI agents and LLM applications that utilize tool-calling capabilities, protecting against sophisticated adversarial attacks that attempt to manipulate model behavior through crafted prompts.

# Core Features  

## 1. Prompt Semantics Inspection (PSI)
- **What it does**: Analyzes incoming prompts for semantic anomalies and injection attempts using token-level embedding distance checks
- **Why it's important**: First line of defense against prompt injection attacks that attempt to hijack tool selection or execution
- **How it works**: Uses pre-trained embeddings to detect perturbations, flagging injected suffixes or out-of-distribution instructions

## 2. Tool Invocation Anomaly Detection System (TIADS)
- **What it does**: Monitors and models normal vs. anomalous tool invocation behavior patterns
- **Why it's important**: Detects sophisticated attacks that may bypass semantic inspection by identifying unusual usage patterns
- **How it works**: Logs invocation sequences, trains ML models to classify abnormal tool usage patterns in real-time

## 3. Prompt Execution Sandbox (PES)
- **What it does**: Provides a safe simulation environment for tool execution before real execution
- **Why it's important**: Prevents malicious tool calls from affecting production systems while maintaining functionality
- **How it works**: Simulates tool execution with shadow outputs, only committing if validation passes

## 4. Prompt Injection Fuzzing Framework (PIFF)
- **What it does**: Generates adversarial variants of prompts to test system robustness
- **Why it's important**: Proactive security testing to identify vulnerabilities before they're exploited
- **How it works**: Supports both rule-based and model-based fuzzing attacks for comprehensive testing

# User Experience  

## User Personas
- **Security Engineers**: Primary users who configure and monitor the defense system
- **AI Application Developers**: Integrate the system into their MCP-compatible agents
- **System Administrators**: Deploy and maintain the security infrastructure

## Key User Flows
1. **Real-time Protection**: Incoming prompts → PSI analysis → TIADS evaluation → PES validation → Safe execution
2. **Security Monitoring**: Continuous logging → Anomaly detection → Alert generation → Response coordination
3. **Proactive Testing**: PIFF test generation → Vulnerability assessment → System hardening
