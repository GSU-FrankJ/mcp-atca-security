# Python 规则

- Follow PEP 8 style guides and naming conventions
- Enhancing Code Readability and Type Safety with Type Annotations
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies:
  - Prioritize `venv` or `poetry` for environment isolation
  - Use `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to document dependencies.
- Use context managers for resources (e.g., file operations)
- Prioritize the use of list derivatives, generator expressions, and dictionary derivatives
- Use `pytest` for testing to maintain high test coverage.
- Document functions, classes and modules using docstrings.
- Follow the principles of object-oriented design (SOLID).
- Use exception handling to ensure program robustness
- Use `dataclasses` or `pydantic` models to represent data
